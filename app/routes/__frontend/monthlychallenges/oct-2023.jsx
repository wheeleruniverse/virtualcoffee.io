			<h2>Theme</h2>
			<p>The 2023 Hacktoberfest!</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<h3>Maintainers</h3>
			<p>
				They provide the repository(ies) with "hacktoberfest" topic(s) and
				issues labeled "hacktoberfest" on their repository(ies). They will also
				answer the contributors' questions, review the pull requests (PRs), and
				validate and merge them following the contest rules.
			</p>

			<h3>Contributors</h3>
			<p>
				They find repository(ies) with "hacktoberfest" topic(s) and issues they
				want to solve. The contest's goal is to have four (4) pull requests
				(PRs) validated and merged during October.
			</p>

			<h3>Mentors</h3>
			<p>
				A mentor will be paired with a mentee (contributor or maintainer). They
				provide support through a 1:1, a pairing session, Slack, or whatever
				works best for the team!
			</p>

			<h2>How to Participate</h2>
			<h3>Before starting</h3>
			<p>
				You can access your dashboard{' '}
				<a href="https://hacktoberfest.virtualcoffee.io/dashboard">here</a> if
				you've signed up for the VC Hacktoberfest Initiative.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Contributors</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Sign up on the{' '}
					<a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">
						Hacktoberfest official website
					</a>
					.
				</li>
				<li>Contact your mentor if you request one.</li>
				<li>
					Check out repositories with the "hacktoberfest" topic and issues on
					GitHub with the "hacktoberfest" label.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>Maintainers</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure you include "hacktoberfest" as a label in your project's
				topics section (found in the "About" section on your repository). That's
				how you opt-in to Hacktoberfest.
			</p>

			<h3>Weekly check-ins</h3>
			<p>
				Let's start the week with an async check-in. What are your goals for
				Hacktoberfest for the week? What support do you need? Do you plan on
				spending time in the <code>#hacktoberfest-co-working-room</code>,
				talking to your mentor, or answering questions as a maintainer?
			</p>
			<p>
				Every Friday of the month, we'll have a sync check-in. Join us, share
				your progress, ask questions, and find help and support. We'll post more
				information in the <code>#hacktoberfest</code> channel in Slack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Can't come to the sync check-in? No problem. We'll also have an async
				check-in in the <code>#hacktoberfest</code> channel on Slack.
			</p>

			<h3>How do I share my progress?</h3>
			<p>
				Share your progress in the <code>#hacktoberfest</code> channel in Slack
				so we can celebrate with you! And if you need support, we'll be there to
				help you, too.
			</p>
			<p>
				While no other platform is imposed, sharing on social media for more
				reach can be a good idea, but only if you are comfortable doing so. You
				can share on X (formerly Twitter) using â€” or not â€” the hashtag{' '}
				<code>#VCHI</code>, a personal blog, a post on{' '}
				<a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a>, you get the idea!
			</p>
			<p>
				Sharing every time you add some work is a good idea. Small progress is
				still progress. There is no need to write a detailed blog post. A
				140-character post on X can be enough. For example, "
				<em>Today, I submitted my first PR for Hacktoberfest. #VCHI</em>"
			</p>

			<h3>What if I need help?</h3>
			<p>
				You can ask questions and ask for ideas and help in the{' '}
				<code>#hacktoberfest</code> channel in Slack or join the{' '}
				<code>#hacktoberfest-co-working-room</code>. Asking for help is part of
				the process!
			</p>

			<p>And remember, we're always here to help! ðŸ’™</p>

			<h3>Completing the Challenge!</h3>
			<p>
				To complete the challenge, you need to complete four meaningful
				contributions during October. It can be creating a PR, writing a good
				issue, creating content such as a blog post or video about contributing
				to a project, helping to answer questions or triaging issues, meeting
				with your mentee, and so on. Share your progress in the{' '}
				<code>#hacktoberfest</code> channel on Slack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, VC is here to support you during Hacktoberfest but is not an
				official event partner. To complete the Hacktoberfest, you must have
				four (4) pull requests (PRs) accepted.
			</p>
